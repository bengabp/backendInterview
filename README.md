## Fastapi Contacts Api

Hi ben.
Hope you doing well.

This assessment task is really a good for a growing one. This assessment help me in future to further polished my skill and also good for experience. I tried my best to understand your requirements and i also do my best. The get list by time range is really difficult for me. Maybe it may occur some error.
In future i tried to learn how to get data in date range.
Thanks.

Now i explain the flow of code and files.

this code will run with this command

"uvicorn app:app --reload "

I also add requirements.txt for the best practice of run with desired response.
I use fast api as my framework, so it's very easy to understand.

in router file i add all routes of Contacts.
manage all business logic in Manager.py file
and manage all database query in database.py file.
if you want to change any thing just edit your own way.
I used Mongodb atlas for remote database. and  i also add the URL of mongodb atlas in config file.
In this projecct i used pydantic models.

Thanks for this assessment
